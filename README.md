# OkCupid-dating-app-NLP

I chose a project about dating apps because it's quite personal topic for me. I have some experiance with various dating apps as I used them on and off mostly between 2018 and 2020. I tried a good few platforms that are out there and OkCupid was among them. I liked the idea that OkCupid users had to put at least some effort into writing in thier profile. I thoguht it would give a better feel about a person. 

Choosing this project I was curious about overall data. I only saw a small portion of people out there tat were recommended to me as a potential match. I wanted to know whether there are more men or women looking for a potetial match, what is the biggest user age group, are they more educated, smokers etc. All those elemnets and more play an imoprtant role when using dating apps and trying to find your perfect match. I also wanted to find out what people say in their essays. Is it just me being cranky thinking that the writing seems repetitive or it actully was the case? Are they trying to stay up- beat or I'd be able to spot some Negative Nancys out there? 
I also wanted to find out what the overall feel was about OkCupid app- hence scarppig the Reddit comments. Reddit is 
'social news aggregation, content rating, and discussion website' so I figured I'll find an iformative content there. 

This project conatins 3 parts:
Part 1. Exploring OkCupid users data.
Part 2. Exploring users essays through n-grams, most frequent words, Word Clouds and sentiment analysis with TextBolb and Vader.
Part 3. Scrapping sub-reddit OkCupid for comments between January 2020 and July 2021 and then text exploraion using techiques mentioned above. 

Data used in this project were from Kaggel: https://www.kaggle.com/andrewmvd/okcupid-profiles and also scarpped from OkCupid subreddit by me.
